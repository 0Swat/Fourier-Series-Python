# Project Title: Fast and Discrete Fourier Transform Simulation

## Description

This Python project implements both the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms to analyze the frequency components of digital signals. It supports one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) data inputs, allowing for the transformation of complex signal arrays. The project includes functionalities for performing inverse transformations (IDFT and IFFT) to reconstruct the original signals. It features visualization tools for illustrating input signals, their frequency spectra, and the reconstructed signals post-transformation.

## Features

-   Support for 1D and 2D DFT and FFT.
-   Implementation of inverse transformations (IDFT and IFFT).
-   Visualization of input signals, frequency spectra, and reconstructed signals.
-   Ability to handle complex number inputs.
-   Performance metrics to compare DFT and FFT efficiencies.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   Matplotlib
-   Numpy
-   Mpl_toolkits

Ensure these libraries are installed in your Python environment.

## Installation

Clone this repository or download the script directly. No additional installation is required, assuming Python and the necessary libraries are already set up on your system.

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the script from your terminal:

shell

`python <script_name>.py` 

Replace `<script_name>` with the actual file name of the script.

Upon execution, the script prompts for input data characteristics (dimensionality and values). Based on the input, it performs the specified Fourier transformation and displays the results through various plots.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the project, such as optimizing algorithms, extending functionality, or improving visualization techniques, are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
